This project is part of the Sigaa-X's application suite.

Absolutely designed to provide a clean, fast and atractive web vision for the academic 
application used in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, it becomes with a smooth 
front-end made from students to students.


## Usage

To get you started you can simply clone the repo and put it inside a web server (like Apache)
to prevent Cross Origin Request bugs.

Now you can open the folder sigaa-x/app and the index.html should renderize like a charm.
